Modes of lookup on cycle
========================

- Parent lookup: iterates the chain and adds the new element just before the
  repetition. Call: addParent(element, source) to the Parent. If source ===
  Parent the repetition has occurred, otherwise forward the call.
- Son lookup: double linked cycle. The reference to the Son is direct so the
  algorithm is simpler, but the both the reference to the Parent in the new 
  element and the current Son, and the reference to Son in the new element, and the reference to the Son in the current element have to be updated. 
  Messier and repetition implied.
- Transform matrix? If the adjacency matrix is readily at hand, a matrix
  transformation may be the best solution.

Parent lookup is the only interesting one because is the only recursive one and
it keeps the complexity at the lesser level.

Infinity is not a goal. Infinity is a size
==========================================

We perceive functions as if we were the differential–as if the function was a
moving entity and it was described by the update operation which occurs in each
instant of our time. We see functions as descriptions of tendencies, always 
in potency, we need to imagine the full actualization of a function to 
understand it so we end up imagining infinity as a _destination_ to which you
_arrive_ if you keep walking the function (updating your position according to
the differential equation) long enough. We don´t understand intuitively that
infinity is not a destination but a cardinality, a name for the size given 
_axiomatically_ to the sets that contain numbers and continuous functions over
them.

The modism "and so on to infinity" is not helpful–it supports the misleading
impression that infinity is something you reach. You could imagine the 
expression mutated into "and so on for the rest of the instances".

Actualization of a self-referencing procedure is Freudian Drive
===============================================================

Partial actualization of a potential in a recursive structure that is 
ultimately self-referential is a periodic process. That is the beauty of 
paradoxes. This means that actualization can be seen as always occurring in 
motion and actualization does not mean final definition. This type of 
actualization that gives place to a new potential has, I believe, a relation
with the idea of drive that Zizek describes.
