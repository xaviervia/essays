I agree with the point of the article. Suffering is, indeed, inexcusable, and it dominates our experience of life in a way that enjoyment does not compensate. I follow the argumentation to the logical conclusion, and I agree with it; but I have, however, several problems with the implicit premises over which the argument is constructed.

The effort put in the construction of this argument is a way in which it manifests the fact that I consider the reasoning of the article to be sound, and its topic and conclusions significant. I also more or less agree with the outlines of the argument, and I strongly sympathize with the idea that taking personal responsibility in the effort for the minimization of suffering is a moral ideal. I think reflecting on the lines that the article proposes is extremely important and relevant, and just pondering this subjects can lead to improvements on our overall moral behavior. Nonetheless, I believe the article conclusions are wrong, even if they are wrong for the right reasons.

Some aspect of the article that I find particularly valuable is its emphasis in anti-utopianism. That it acknowledges that radical conclusions such as the ones argued by the author can be coopted by utopian ideologies that end up maximizing suffering is a testament to the fact that the author is taking the topic seriously (and is familiar with recent history). Particularly good is, in this sense, that it highlights the value of adoption that stems from an anti-natalist perspective: mitigating suffering where it can be mitigated.

My problems with the premises vary widely in regards to what quality of the argument the refer to, but even coming from different angles, what the have in common is that they are foundational: they all point to the underlying axioms under which the argument sustains itself. Here is a break down by topic:

## Metaphysical

> How can we compare existence with non-existence, if in order to do that comparison we need first to exist? It feels to me that this is an argumentation in the vacuum: nothing can be said about the qualities of non-existence, since saying something presupposes existence. There is no such thing as an "experience" of non-existence, which makes it really hard to put qualities to it (in this case, being better than existence, because of the pain that existence brings with it). I feel that this might be the strongest argument against the conclusion, and it resonates with the fact that because only natalists reproduce, anti-natalism is by it's very structure a non-replicant and biologically determined to minority status (which is of course addressed in the article, but only at the sociological level)

The word "metaphysical" is unfortunately sometimes connected with superstition, but I’m referring here to metaphysics in the Aristotelian understanding of the word: that, as the careful reflection about the nature of being, which by not being empirical cannot, by definition, be a scientific endeavor.

This is in a way the strongest argument, since it aims at the bottom, the core assumption in the article, which is that non-existence can, and in certain cases is, better than existence (so the article goes).

Let’s phrase this core tenant of the argument in a way that we can easily reason about:

> Non existence has the property of being better than existence

The problematic part is that non-existence is, logically speaking, a non-starter. Under propositional logic, any judgment can be deduced from a false premise. This is a similar situation: non-existence cannot have valid logical predicates. The idea that non-existence can be _better_ than existence fails at this propositional logic level.

I am aware that there are other, less mainstream formulations of logic that do not have the [principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion), such as the various forms of para consistent logic. This could potentially circumvent the stronger form of my argument; but the flaws of the line of thinking proposed in the article are not exhausted yet.

Another problem with the above statement is that it adds properties to non-existence. This seems, in the face of it, a contradiction. Unless non-existence is defined in terms that do not preclude any positive attributes, it cannot possibly have properties; and in that case, it could be hard to agree that it is still valid to call such construct "non-existence".

This is still not the final metaphysical argument against it: there is also a variation of the anthropic principle. I can imagine putting it like this:

> In order for non-existence to be judged as better than existence, there has to be a scale of better and worse which are properties of the world in which an existing thinker is immersed

That is: if there is no one around to judge non-existence as positive, then non-existence is no longer positive. This sorts of brings as back to the first metaphysical argument: if non-existence can have properties in the absence of existence, then while it might have those properties, [it would have them vacuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).

## Moral value system

The article obviously derived its moral principle from utilitarian logic, given that it arguments on the lines of comparing the amount of perceived suffering and perceived enjoyment, taking the first one as axiomatically bad and the second as axiomatically good. This is a good starting point, and utilitarian morality is certainly a powerful tool that has given us a lot of useful insights into ways of working towards the improvement of society.

It is however not a complete description of the human experience. This is not a criticism, since I know utilitarian moralists are usually not stupid and do not think that the world can be reduced to an equation such as:

> Life worthiness = Enjoyment / Suffering

It is still worth pointing out, however, than the article draws a pretty damning conclusion as a logical result of applying this formula, and that it extends the conclusion to human life in general. So in a way, the utilitarian moralist implied in that article _is_ asserting that the experience of life can be simplified to that.

I do not go to go anywhere deep regarding alternative moral value systems: but I want at least to mention the fact that this simple utilitarian formula might be wrong from a scientific perspective. I can expand on this in two ways:

- Suffering is not properly defined from a scientific perspective, and any self respecting utilitarian morality needs to acknowledge that fact, since the core of the utilitarian ethos is empiricism. The quality of suffering is certainly colored in our real experience of it by an innumerable amount of factors, and the fact that all of us have biological drives that makes us crave for controlled dosis of suffering makes it questionable the assumption that the eradication of suffering is the right moral choice, even within pure utilitarianism.

- The array of experiences that a human has can provide alternative axis of morality; rather than the enjoyment-suffering one, we can propose to use the meaningfulness-meaninglessness one. The [experience of positive meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is not a wishy-washy new age non sense either: it is an active area of research within experimental psychology. We can easily see how experiences that produce suffering also produce the feeling of meaning: for example, succeeding at an extremely hard task. The idea that the point of life is just to get the dopamine kick that comes with the positive resolution of the task ignores the fact that a dopamine kick "in the vacuum" does not have the same neurological effect that one produced during flow does.

The interesting thing about this second idea, that if setting the utilitarian morality axis in a different direction, is that the result of following the exact same argument line that the article is to arrive to drastically different conclusions: rather than eliminating being, our goal should be to make the experience of being more and more meaningful. The traditional skeptic counter argument to this train of thought is that "meaning" is not a positive category; hopefully I undermined this argument by pointing out that the experience of meaning is a relevant psychological fact, and as real as pain as far as we are concerned, so within the framework of utilitarianism, it is as useful a metric. This will lead us to the next point, which is that the whole article might be guilty of just ending up in eating its own tail; reaching a conclusion that is already part of the axioms; but before going there, let’s take a look at a core part of the argumentation in the article that really goes to show why the "meaning" aspect as a challenge to "enjoyment" in the base of a rational morality is not an arbitrary choice. Quote from the quote at the start of the article:

> [...] I don’t have much time left and the unavoidable will happen soon. My life has been pure hell and I don’t even know what to think anymore. Certainly, sentencing someone to such a world is the worst of all crimes, and a serious moral violation. If it wasn’t by my parents’ selfish desire, I wouldn’t be here today suffering what I suffer for no reason at all, I could have been spared in the absolute peace of non-existence but I am here living this daily torture.

The story told in there is certainly heart breaking, and I do not plan on arguing for a morality where experiences like that one are considered good. Let’s however, take a close look at where our impression of "wrongness" stems from here. Let me highlight one phrase in particular:

> If it wasn’t by my parents’ selfish desire, I wouldn’t be here today suffering what I suffer **for no reason at all**,

If your experience reading this excerpts was anything like main you did not have a direct experience of pain from them: not a physical one at least (discounting the somatic expression of the psychological distress). What you did had, is a feeling of despair, a drying of the mouth that signals that the world as a whole has become a dark place, a place which meaning is not one that you would like to be associated with.

Isn’t it true that the more poignant point of the experience, the most negative aspect of it, is the fact that the suffering is meaningless? Again, I do not plan here on drawing definite conclusions: I just think it is worth postulating the fact that the overall dark tone of the article and the gloomy feeling that existence is not worth is might be anchored rather in the feeling of meaningless rather in a rejection of suffering.

This also has strong biological roots. In an creature that evolved through selection, sensibility to suffering is a positive trait. Suffering is, after all, the way our psyche manifest that we need to change the situation in which we are or we might be destroyed soon. Consequently, arguing for the elimination of suffering makes it also life as a project inviable, since a mechanism which selects for the trait of experiencing enjoyment when you are wounded would rapidly lead to complete extinction.

Biologically speaking too, the feeling of meaning is associated with the idea of being engaged in the activities that lead to life continuing. This is broader than narrow enjoyment: where enjoyment only covers the feeling of eating the food, meaning covers also the hunting process. Where enjoyment only covers having sex, meaning also covers the mating rituals that surround sex in time. Where enjoyment only covers lying comfortable in bed, meaning also covers the physical effort of productive activities.

And now we are ready to address the final objection to the article, which is in a way the most powerful from a critical theory perspective, since it aims at the ideological context of the argumentation.

## Romanticism and Rationalism

Romanticism is, in this context, the belief that rationalism is simply not equipped to reach conclusions about the human experience (or complex animal experience for that matter). At the face of it, it sounds like such as perspective makes it simply impossible to have a discussion of the kind that we are having right now; however, the main insight of romanticism is not that rationality is useless, but rather that rationality as a method for experience analysis (Rationalism) is fundamentally incomplete.

Rationalism is a belief system heavily inspired by the scientific method. After the great success of material science in giving material prosperity to human civilization based on the principles of empiricism and logical thinking, many people had the idea of following the same set of principles and using the same formal framework to analyze human experience in general.

There is, however, a well known problem with this: the scientific method is concerned with objects deprived of intrinsic value, not because Science as an edifice posits that objects lack intrinsic value, but rather because it resulted rather effective to treat them that way when analyzing their behavior—inanimated objects, at the very least. But this postulate, namely:

> Objects lack intrinsic value

…is not a logical conclusion that scientific analysis derived from observing the world. Quite the opposite: it is the **axiom** set at the base of the scientific method. And axioms are just arbitrary rules in a formal system. They say nothing about the underlying structure of the universe.

By necessity, a system of thought founded on the premise that reality is composed of objects with equivalent value applied to analysis of the human experience will jump straight into nihilism. But, and this is the core point here:

> Nihilism, or the absence of inherent meaning in reality, is not a _conclusion_ of rationalism; it is it's foundational axiom.

You can see how then any argumentation line that starts of purely rationalistic premises and reaches nihilistic conclusions can be fairly regarded with suspicion. Is this careful crafted step by step logical derivation of theorems that lead to a true judgement applicable to the universe at large? The fact that the argument is internally consistent with it's axiomatical framework only means that it is well formed: if the axioms upon which it lies are not connected with reality, there is no useful information embedded in it.

I’ll jump right ahead and point out that I’m not saying this invalidates the argument, because saying so will also imply that nothing at all can be said about the human experience, which is not a position I subscribe to. Some people do in fact say that nothing at all can be said about human experience, and they either didn’t think long enough before speaking or are unfazed by paradoxes.


So what do I want to say? In a nugget, that all axiomatizations of the human experience that we know of light up different aspects of it and can probably help out in building a sufficiently useful description with which to communicate, but they certainly do not exhaust the possibilities of that experience, and more certainly so, no single axiomatization can possibly cover it.

## Conclusion

The flaws in the argument do not automatically make it invalid; even within a wider framework for morality, being a truly moral person requires a deep understanding of nihilism in all its expressions, and why it is such a prevalent way of describing the world. I would be disappointed if I give the impression that I plan of discarding the argument with a slight of the hand, not taking it seriously, or if it seems that my counter arguments mean its train of argumentation is not worth pursuing. The opposite is the truth.

I do believe, however, that there are rational, scientific paths to overcoming it, while retaining some of its core insights. Those paths are rooted in redirecting the axis of utilitarianism from enjoyment-suffering to meaning-meaninglessness, in acknowledging the fact that wishing for non-existence is not viable from a biological or even ontological perspective and that the idea of meaninglessness is not a necessary conclusion, but rather more like a collective illusion given to us as a sort of price for material dominion.

It seems to me that in way or the other, we are stuck with being. If that is the only option, we might as well find ways to do good within the boundaries of it. Having children is our embodied expression of the belief that, even if we fail to find a way to make reality a paradise, they still have a chance to find it. Humanity is a common project that did not start with you and me and will not end with you and me, so it is productive to think that wider frame, especially when evaluating existence.

Extra content: a couple of notes I have about the article that do not fit within the structure of the main thing:

### Death

I am aware the article does not rely on the idea of death for reaching its conclusion, and it uses it only as an example. There are still interesting things to be said about the arguments made there:

- Death as the ultimate pain is not a warranted assumption. We do not know if death is painful, because, well, we can’t know.
- The idea of "death always looming" as a source of pain is not a self consistent argument with classic utilitarianism: a purely rational utilitarian agent would simply maximize enjoyment within the temporal boundaries of its own existence. The only way in which the idea of death can be a source of pain is if death threatens the _meaning_ of living, rather than its immediate enjoyment. Under this light (I know I’m biased) all argumentation about death that the article does gives weight to the idea that the moral height is meaningfulness, not enjoyment. Really, there is nothing to be said about enjoyment-suffering when talking about death, which within the boundaries of what we know, can be made painless by chemical means.
- Temporal boundaries of life are not a meaningful source of critique: by themselves, temporal boundaries are simply a necessity of existence, in exactly the same way that spatial boundaries are. A being that is all encompassing in time is not a being about which we can make meaningful statements.

### Humans as means of destruction

The destruction of life is not exactly a very solid argument for one that has reached the conclusion that non-existence is preferable to existence:

- Higher forms of life are as capable of suffering as humans are. The selection mechanisms that made sure that we are sensitive to suffering are also 100% true for animals as well. If we reach the conclusion that non-existence is preferable to existence for being with such sensitivity to pain, then our moral imperative is to immediately start taking steps to prevent reproduction in animal species that are affected by this affliction. As one can see, this would lead to the extinction of virtually all vertebrates (as I write this, we apparently don’t fully know if fish can experience pain, but I would bet that they do, because why wouldn’t they). It can hardly be argued that another human is a bad thing because it damages the environment.
- Still on the topic of superior animals, damaged done by humans to suffering-capable organism can be avoided by changing our diets. Many among us indeed recognize that and already took serious steps to make that happen. If humans are capable of such changes can be seen as unlikely, but I tend to shy away from considering things like this unlikely, since many unlikely things took place already. It is certainly more likely that we make sure not to include animal suffering in our diets than that we stop making more people altogether.
- For the life forms that do not experience suffering: why is damaging the environment a moral concern? I’m of course asking that question within the limits of the utilitarian morality. Massive extinction events already took place on the planet several time without there being humans to intervene; in some occasions, the victims were just bacteria. In other, they were insects and trees. What is the problem then? Why assigning moral value to the preservation of an environment that can’t feel?
