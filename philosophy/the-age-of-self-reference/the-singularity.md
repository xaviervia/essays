At its most fundamental, life is information.

Information has a dynamic that is native to it. Life's rules are built on top of the rules of information. The way that information propagates itself it thus of great significance for life.

Information is preserved by replication. The physical containers of information are constantly at risk of being destroyed, so the information inside needs to be replicated constantly so not to get lost. By necessity, information that in one way or another facilitates replication will last longer than information that is harder to replicate.

Life is such a phenomenon. Biological life is a form of information that is bundled in a physical container which is able to replicate that information. Since the initial molecules of DNA or RNA started replicating at some point in the distant past, life is, in the most simplistic terms, a continuous sequence of replications by the same molecule. This is a simplistic description, but it is still a correct one.

At the start of the internet era, humanity was confronted with the realization that life is, at its core, just information. This is not something completely new, and it is not something outside the boundaries of the imagination, but the internet brought with itself a disturbing implication that was not pondered in depth before: that with the new forms of information in electronic devices, we can potentially create, or witness the appearance, of radically new forms of life.

Many analysis of this awakening fall into a series of cliches that I would like to completely avoid, and in some particular cases, refute. I believe the most effective way of doing that is focusing on the most salient reaction to this realization: the deep existential anxiety triggered by the impossibility to pretend that life needs to be biological in nature, and the true object of this anxiety which relate to human psychology itself, beyond the surface of the historical phenomenon of the internet.

Let's start:

## The Singularity

Brushing aside for the moment superficial manifestations of the anxiety provoked by non-biological life (such as stories about robots taking over the earth and wiping out the humans for some vaguely formulated reason), let's jump straight to one of the most refined versions of this anxiety: the idea of our imminent and unavoidable historical fate to be swept in into something called the Singularity.

The simplest formulation of the Singularity is a mathematical analogy: if the progression of computing power keeps up with the current trend, then computers will soon become so intelligent to be able to surpass us. After that, there is the potential to reach what is called the Singularity itself: the point in which technological development is no longer in the hands of humans, and thus history is disrupted by a new subject of superhuman intelligence which make any speculation about the direction of history past that point impossible in principle.

The exact form in which the Singularity could arise is the subject of much debate, and we might come back to it since the various possibilities reveal more details about the undercurrent anxiety motivating their formulations, but even in its simplest form, the idea of the Singularity already presents many of the interesting aspects that allow us to make a diagnostic of the culture at the present time. Let's break them down.

- The idea of the Singularity is a self-defeating teleology of history. The proponents of the Singularity as an historical inevitability necessarily believe that history has a direction, which fits them square into the teleological school of thought about history. Not surprisingly, the Singularity is particularly popular among people working in the technological industry, where the idea of social and technological progress is prevalent.

In this sense, the idea of a Singularity is somewhat pre formulated by the idea of technological and social progress, but there are several matices in which they differ that has profound implications.
  - The idea of progress implies some vaguely defined target that is in the undetermined future. It could be then argued that teleology is already there. There is true in that, but just "progress" masks
