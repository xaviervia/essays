> I recently came across an article about anti-natalism by recommendation of a friend. I have been pondering similar topics in recent times; I have been thinking about nihilism, and the anti-natalist argument relies on nihilism as one of its core premises. Even while initially reading the article, I was able to construct in my mind a coherent set of counter arguments, which—I now realize—are the crystallization of thinking about nihilism in general, and in particular from the ontological, sociological and moral perspective. In this essay I lay down those counter arguments.

# Arguments for Natalism

This is a response to the [Kids? Just say no](https://aeon.co/essays/having-children-is-not-life-affirming-its-immoral) article, which advocates for an anti-natalist morality. In a nutshell, it puts on a scale the amount of suffering and the amount of enjoyment that a human being experiences and that he or she makes other experience. The scale tips hard, and it is in the direction of suffering. This quote from the article illustrates the point really well:

> If you doubt this, ask yourself – honestly – whether you would accept a minute of the worst tortures in exchange for a minute or two of the greatest delights.

Given this state of affairs, the article drives to the conclusion, in a well reasoned way, that creating more human life is not moral. This is just a gist of course, the article is well put and easy to read, so I recommend reading it.

I agree with the point of the article. Suffering is, indeed, inexcusable, and it dominates our experience of life in a way that enjoyment does not compensate for. I follow the argumentation to the logical conclusion, and I agree with it to the extent that it is a valid conclusion that follows from the premises; but I have, however, several problems with the premises.

I hope that the effort that I put in the construction of this counter argument goes to show that I consider the reasoning of the article to be sound, and its topic and conclusions significant. The counter arguments that I put forward apply in a wider context than anti-natalism and can be seen as a rebuttal of nihilism in general; but in here, I construct them here to address anti-natalism in particular.

Given the importance of the decision of having children, this is not my first encounter with the topic, and I feel more or less prepared to give a coherent counter argument because I frequently pondered argumentations done along the same lines since many years ago. For starters, I agree with the outlines of the argument, and I strongly sympathize with the moral ideal of taking personal responsibility in the collective effort for the minimization of suffering. I think reflecting along the lines that the article proposes is extremely important and relevant, and just pondering this subject can lead to improvements in our overall moral behavior. Nonetheless, I believe the article conclusions are wrong, even if they are wrong for the right reasons.

One aspect of the article that I find particularly valuable is its emphasis in anti-utopianism. The writer acknowledges that radical conclusions about the human condition can be coopted by utopian ideologies that end up maximizing suffering, which runs directly counter to the proposed morality. This is a testament to the fact that the author is taking the topic seriously (and that he is familiar with recent history). In this sense, it is particularly good that it highlights the value of adoption. This follows logically from an anti-natalist ethos: whenever the possibility of suffering is present, it should be mitigated.

My counter arguments are not a matter of content: rather, they are foundational. My problems with the premises cover very different qualities of the argument; but even though the counter argument go the attack from different angles, what the have in common is that they are foundational. They all take aim at the underlying axioms under which the argument sustains itself.

Broken down by topic, they are:

- The **Metaphysical** counter argument
- The **Moral value system** counter argument
- The **Romantic (or anti-rationalistic)** counter argument

Let's start:

## Metaphysical counter argument

The word "metaphysical" is sometimes connected with superstition, but I’m referring here to metaphysics in the Aristotelian understanding of the word: that, as the careful reflection about the nature of Being. This is also called "ontology", as the study of Being proper.

This one is, in a way the strongest argument, since it aims at the bottom, the core assumption in the article, which is that non-existence can, and in certain cases is, better than existence (so the article goes).

To see how a metaphysical counter argument can be constructed, let’s phrase out this core tenant of the article in a way that we can easily reason about:

> Non existence has the property of being better than existence

The problem is that non-existence, logically speaking, is a really bad starting point. Under propositional logic, any judgment can be deduced from a false premise. You can say that non-existence has a property, and that this property is that it is better than existence: and this is technically true, but it is true in the same sense that saying "all the people that live right now in Mars are blue" is true: it is a vacuous truth in logic which is technically right because anything can be stated about non existing members of an empty set. Phrased in another way: it is meaningless to assign predicates to non-existence. The idea that non-existence can be _better_ than existence fails at this propositional logic level.

I am aware that there are other, less mainstream formulations of logic that do not have the [principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion), such as the various forms of paraconsistent logic. This could potentially circumvent the stronger form of my argument; but the metaphysical flaws of the line of thinking proposed in the article are not exhausted.

When it comes to mathematical truths and their relationship with reality, there are usually to camps:

- Formalists consider that logical propositions are just rules for string manipulation
- Platonists (applied to mathematics, not in general) consider that mathematical objects are real entities in the physical universe

The argument that follows only works if you consider the formalist standpoint, but it is nonetheless worth pursuing, since the consequences of mathematical platonism are vast and may introduce a different set of questions.

According to mathematical formalism, reasoning, even abstract, mathematical reasoning, is something that does not exist in nature unless it is _acted out_. In order for a logic statement to the true, it needs to be evaluated, so that it's truth value might be revealed. This is a simplification, but in a nutshell what this means is that logic predicates are not automatically real things in a universe without thinkers: they require processes capable of formulating and operating them to be real, as real as they can be while embedded in that process.

And this leads to a problem: if we annihilate existence because we think non-existence is better, who is there to think that existence is bad?

This is of course just a flavor or variation of the anthropic principle. I can imagine putting it like this:

> In order for non-existence to be judged as better than existence, there has to be a scale of better and worse which are properties of the world in which an existing thinker is immersed

That is: if there is no one around to judge non-existence as positive, then non-existence is no longer positive.

How can we compare existence with non-existence, if in order to do that comparison we need first to exist? It seems to me that, as conscious thinkers operating within a value system, nothing we can formulate as qualities of non-existence can be truthful, since our experience where our values emerge is automatically existent as a prerequisite. As mentioned before, stating properties of something either posits its existence or leads to vacuous truths.

There is no such thing as an "experience" of non-existence, which makes it really hard to put qualities to it (in this case, being better than existence, because of the pain that existence brings with it).

This of course resonates with the fact that because only natalists reproduce, anti-natalism is by it's very structure a non-replicant and biologically determined to minority status (which is of course addressed in the article, but only at the sociological level).

## Moral value system counter argument

The article obviously derived its moral principle from utilitarian logic, given that it compares the amount of perceived suffering and perceived enjoyment, taking the first one as axiomatically bad and the second as axiomatically good. This is a good starting point, and utilitarian morality is certainly a powerful tool that has given us a lot of useful insights into ways of working towards the improvement of society.

It is however not a complete description of the human experience. This is not a criticism, since I know utilitarian moralists are usually not stupid and do not think that the world can be reduced to an equation such as:

> Life worthiness = Enjoyment / Suffering

…so I don’t believe they missed the fact that life is complex out of lack of sophistication.

It is still worth pointing out, however, than the article draws a pretty damning conclusion as a logical result of applying this formula; and that then it extends the conclusion to human life in general. So in a way, the utilitarian moralist implied in that article _is_ asserting that the experience of life can be simplified to that.

I do not want to go too deep regarding alternative moral value systems: but I want at least to mention the fact that this simple utilitarian formula is probably wrong from a scientific perspective. I can expand on this in two ways:

- Suffering is not properly defined from a scientific perspective. Any self respecting utilitarian morality needs to acknowledge this fact, since the core of the utilitarian ethos is empiricism. The quality of suffering is certainly colored in our real experience of it by an innumerable amount of factors, and the fact that all of us have biological drives that makes us crave for controlled dosis of suffering makes it questionable the assumption that the _complete_ eradication of suffering is the right moral choice, even within pure utilitarianism.

- The array of experiences that a human has can provide alternative axis of morality; rather than the enjoyment-suffering one, we can propose to use the meaningfulness-meaninglessness one. The [experience of positive meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is not a wishy-washy new age non sense either: it is an active area of research within experimental psychology. We can easily see how some experiences that produce suffering might at the same time also produce the feeling of meaning: for example, succeeding at an extremely hard task. The idea that the point of life is just to get the dopamine kick that comes with the positive resolution of the task ignores the fact that a dopamine kick "in the vacuum" does not have the same neurological effect that one produced during _flow_ does. Neural wiring occurs a result of a creative process and when carrying a hard task to completion that is completely different from the one that occurs when taking dosis of heroin.

Let’s go a little deeper with the meaningfulness-meaninglessness axis.

The interesting thing about this idea, that of setting the utilitarian morality axis in a different direction, is that by following the exact same argument line that the article presents, we arrive to drastically different conclusions: rather than eliminating being, our goal should be to make the experience of being more meaningful than it currently is.

The traditional skeptic counter argument to this train of thought is that "meaning" is not a positive category; hopefully I undermined this argument by pointing out that the experience of meaning is a relevant psychological fact, as real as pain as far as we are concerned, so within the framework of utilitarianism, it is as useful a metric. (this will lead us to the next point, which is that the whole article might be guilty of just ending up in eating its own tail, reaching a conclusion that is already part of the axioms, stemming up from the choice of rules: we will come back to this in the next section, let’s stick with the meaning-meaninglessness idea for now)

"Meaning" as an alternative base of a rational morality is not an arbitrary choice in this argumentation. Here is an excerpt from the quote at the beginning of the article:

> [...] I don’t have much time left and the unavoidable will happen soon. My life has been pure hell and I don’t even know what to think anymore. Certainly, sentencing someone to such a world is the worst of all crimes, and a serious moral violation. If it wasn’t by my parents’ selfish desire, I wouldn’t be here today suffering what I suffer for no reason at all, I could have been spared in the absolute peace of non-existence but I am here living this daily torture.

The story told in there is certainly heart breaking, and I do not plan on arguing for a morality where experiences like that one are considered good. Let’s, however, take a careful look at where our impression of "wrongness" stems from in here. Let me highlight one phrase in particular:

> If it wasn’t by my parents’ selfish desire, I wouldn’t be here today suffering what I suffer **for no reason at all**,

If your experience reading the original quote was anything like mine, you did not have a direct experience of pain from it: not a physical one at least (discounting the somatic expression of the psychological distress). What you did had, is a feeling of despair, a drying of the mouth that signals that the world as a whole has become a dark place, a place whose meaning is not one that you would like to be associated with.

Isn’t it true that the more poignant point of the story, the most negative aspect of it, is not the awful suffering itself, but the fact that the suffering is _meaningless_? Again, I do not plan here on drawing definite conclusions: I just think it is worth postulating the fact that the overall dark tone of the article and the gloomy feeling that existence is not worth is might be anchored rather in the feeling of meaningless rather in a rejection of suffering. If we reconstruct the argument around this axis, we will find out that the experience of meaningless is also a fact, as much as suffering, and we should definitely strive to minimize: but the jury is out regarding whether or not the balance between the experience of meaningfulness and of meaninglessness tip to the meaninglessness side in the same way that the balace between enjoyment and suffering tips to the suffering side. And this has gigantic implications for the conclusion.

> Note that I’m not saying that this means life is automatically moral. If meaninglessness is a more common experience than meaningfulness, life might still be immoral: the argument here is that we haven’t yet consider this (and I don’t feel equipped to attempt a conclusion)

There are strong biological roots for taking this approach. Sensibility to harm is a useful trait; escaping from harm drastically improves the chances or survival and reproduction, it is selected by evolution. Suffering is, after all, the way our psyche manifest that we need to change the situation in which we are or we might be destroyed soon. Consequently, arguing for the elimination of suffering makes it also life as a project inviable, since a mechanism which selects for the trait of experiencing enjoyment when you are wounded would rapidly lead to complete extinction.

Meaning on the other hand can give suffering a context in which it does not eliminate the value of being alive: and the feeling of meaning, which happens during mental flow, is directly related with the overcoming of a difficulty in a manner that does not involve permanent harm but still represents a challenge, so there is also a clear biological case for its development. The feeling of meaning is so associated with the activities that lead to life's perpetuation. It can be seen that this is far broader than narrow enjoyment: where enjoyment only covers the feeling of eating the food, meaning covers also the hunting process. Where enjoyment only covers having sex, meaning also covers the mating rituals that surround sex in time. Where enjoyment only covers lying comfortable in bed, meaning also covers the physical effort of productive activities.

And now we are ready to address the final objection to the article, the most powerful from a critical theory perspective, since it aims at the ideological context of the argumentation.

> While reflecting on this argument, I realized that it can also be considered the most powerful one, since it reveals that the article undermines itself in its claim that suffering is the concern. Then something similar happened when I was thinking about the next one, the romantic one: it seemed to be the best one of them all, for different reasons. And when I went back to the first, it certainly looked like the best, since it was based on logic and all. They all seem to be "the most powerful argument" agains the anti-natalist morality. But this cannot be so.
> But in a way, they are all the most powerful argument: this is simply a manifestation of the fact that they are all foundational, just coming from different conceptual frameworks.

## Romantic (or anti-rationalistic) counter argument

Romanticism is, in this context, the belief that rationalism is simply not equipped to analyze and reach conclusions about the human experience (or complex animal experience in general). In the face of it, it sounds like such a perspective makes it simply impossible to have a discussion of the kind that we are having right now, since we are using reason to analyze experience; however, the main insight of romanticism is not that rationality is useless, but rather that rationality as a method for experience analysis (_rationalism_) is fundamentally _incomplete_.

Rationalism is a belief system heavily influenced by the scientific method (but a belief system nonetheless!). After the great success of material science in giving prosperity to civilization based on the principles of empiricism and logical thinking, many had the idea analyzing human experience in the same way as we analyze the physical world.

There is, however, a well known problem with this: the scientific method is concerned with objects deprived of intrinsic value. This is not because science as an edifice posits that objects _lack_ intrinsic value, but rather because it turned out to be quite effective to _treat them_ that way. To the ends of understanding certain properties of the universe, thinking about it as a collection of value-free objects gave good results, and that made it stick. But you can see that this postulate, namely:

> Objects lack intrinsic value

…is not a logical conclusion that scientific analysis derived from observing the world. Quite the opposite: it is the **axiom** that sits at the base of the scientific method. And axioms are just arbitrary rules in a formal system. They say nothing about the underlying structure of the universe.

Let me stress this, because it is usually missed by people:

> The fact that science is partially successful at predicting the behavior of the world working under the assumption that the reality is composed of objects that lack intrinsic value says _nothing_ about the underlying structure of reality.

This does not mean that the knowledge generated by science is not useful, or that science itself it not worth pursuing. This is just contextual information: science has its limits, and they are demarcated by its very foundations. Science is really good at studying the physical world; but that is what science was optimized to do. Science is not good at everything, because its presuppositions preclude entire categories of knowledge for the sake of method (which is an excellent reason, but again, a limitation). And even more remarkably, it turns out that having the conviction that science is by necessity _good at everything is deeply unscientific_, since it is not a verifiable hypothesis.

This is important, because by logical necessity, a system of thought founded on the premise that reality is composed of objects with equivalent value will, when used to analyze the human experience, jump straight into nihilism. This is the core point here:

> Nihilism, or the absence of inherent meaning in reality, is not a _conclusion_ of rationalism; it is its foundational axiom.

You can see how then any argumentation line that starts out of purely rationalistic premises and reaches nihilistic conclusions is a fair target of suspicion. _"Is this careful crafted step by step logical derivation of theorems that lead to a true judgement really applicable to the universe at large?"_ The fact that the argument is internally consistent with its axiomatical framework only means that it is well formed: but if the axioms upon which it lies are not connected with reality, there is no useful information embedded in it.

I’ll jump right ahead and point out that I’m not saying this invalidates the argument; among other things, because saying so will also imply that nothing at all can be said about the human experience, which is not a position I subscribe to. Some people do in fact say that nothing at all can be _said_ about human experience, and they either didn’t think long enough before speaking or they are unfazed by paradoxes.

So what do I want to say? In a nutshell, that all axiomatizations of the human experience that we know of focus on different aspects of it and can probably help out in building a sufficiently useful description with which to communicate, but cannot possibly exhaust the possibilities of that experience. And we can confident when saying that there is no chance that a single axiomatization can possibly describe human experience.

## Conclusion

The flaws in the argument do not automatically make it invalid; even within a wider framework for morality, being a truly moral person requires a deep understanding of nihilism in all of its expressions. Being moral requires understanding why nihilism is such a prevalent way of describing the world. I would be disappointed if this text gives the impression that I’m discarding the anti-natalist argument with a slight of the hand, not taking it seriously, or if it seems that my counter arguments mean the anti-natalist train of argumentation is not worth pursuing. The opposite is the truth.

I do believe, however, that there are rational, scientific paths to overcoming it, while retaining some of its core insights. Those paths are rooted in:

- Redirecting the axis of utilitarianism from enjoyment-suffering to meaning-meaninglessness (Value system shift)
- Acknowledging the fact that wishing for non-existence is not viable from a biological or even ontological perspective (Anthropic principle)
- Recognizing that meaninglessness is not a necessary conclusion of rational discourse, but rather more like a collective illusion that we received as a sort of price for material prowess (Romanticism)

It seems to me that in way or the other, we are stuck with being. Non-being is not somewhere we can go.

If being is the only option, we might as well find ways to do good within the its boundaries. Having children is our embodied expression of the belief that, even if we fail to find a way to make reality a paradise, they still have a chance to find it. Our moral imperative in that framework is to try as humanly possible to give them the tools to achieve meaning and enjoyment, and to hope that they get to do it to a greater extent than we did.

Humanity is a common project that did not start with you and me and will not end with you and me, so it is productive to think that wider frame, especially when evaluating existence.

## Extra content

A couple of notes about the article that do not fit within the main body of the argumentation above:

### Death

I am aware the article does not rely on the idea of death for reaching its conclusion, and it uses it only as an example. There are still interesting things to be said about the arguments made there:

- _Death as the ultimate pain_ is not a warranted assumption. We do not know if death is painful, because, well, we can’t know.
- Taking _death is always looming_ as a source of pain is not a consistent argument within classic utilitarianism: a purely rational utilitarian agent would simply maximize enjoyment within the temporal boundaries of its own existence. The only way in which the idea of death can be a source of pain is if death threatens the _meaning_ of living, rather than its immediate enjoyment. Under this light all further argumentation about death that the article does only gives more weight to the idea that the moral height is meaningfulness, not enjoyment. Really, there is nothing to be said about enjoyment-suffering when talking about death. Within the boundaries of what we know, death can be made painless by chemical means.
- Temporal boundaries of life are not a meaningful source of critique: by themselves, temporal boundaries are simply a necessity of existence, in exactly the same way that spatial boundaries are. A being that is all encompassing in time is not a being about which we can make meaningful statements.

### Humans as means of destruction

The destruction of life is not exactly a very solid argument for one that has reached the conclusion that non-existence is preferable to existence:

- Higher forms of life are as capable of suffering as humans are. The selection mechanisms that made sure that we are sensitive to suffering are also 100% true for animals and other forms of life. If we reach the conclusion that non-existence is preferable to existence, then our moral imperative is to immediately start taking steps to prevent reproduction of animals that are affected by this affliction. As one can see, this would lead to the extinction of virtually all vertebrates (as I write this, we apparently don’t fully know if fish can experience pain, but I would bet that they do, because _why wouldn’t they_).
- Still on the topic of superior animals, a lot of the damage done by humans to suffering-capable organisms can be avoided by just changing our diets, without the need to lead ourselves to extinction. Many among us indeed recognized this and already took serious steps to make that change happen. The cynic might think it unlikely that humans are capable of such changes, but I tend to shy away from labeling things like as "unlikely", since many unlikely things have taken place already. It is certainly more likely that will stop eating animals altogether than that we will stop making more people.
- For the life forms that do not experience suffering: why is damaging the environment a moral concern? I’m of course asking that question within the limits of the utilitarian morality. Massive extinction events already took place on the planet several times without there being humans to intervene; in some occasions, the victims were just bacteria. In other, they were insects and trees. What is the problem then? Why assigning moral value to the preservation of an environment that can’t feel? It can hardly be argued that another human is a bad thing because it damages the environment, if the environment itself can’t feel pain.
