# Self-driving cars: the kind of idea that only appeals to spoiled rich kids

Let’s talk about cars before diving into their self-driving cousins. There’s a couple of things we need to acknowledge about them before we can fully grasp why self-driving cars is such a problematic concept:

> Cars are weapons

As a kid, your parents had to keep you off the street and teach you to cross through a special place “for people”; they had to teach you to understand and respect street lights; and they had to be dead serious about it, **because the street is full of murder metal boxes traveling at body-shattering speeds**.

Imagine that all cars are suddenly gone from the city. All streets are made walk-only; trees and flowery gardens grow in the freed up spaces; benches and tables are installed, and places are set up to practice sports or just gather together and play guitar or make a barbecue. Some bike lanes criss-cross the city through the main streets. In short: all public space is safe, and turned into a single, city-spanning park.

The gut reaction I get is that this is a wild and impossible dream; a kind of hippie escapism from a stressed-out city dweller. Actually, it is not. There is nothing crazy about that image: for most of history, cities did not have cars. Sure, there were roads and carriages, and we know that city streets were usually dirty and muddy, but the current archetype of a busy street with a small sidewalk is **not** an eternal arrangement of civilization.

If you think about the amount of public space that is given to cars, you can quickly notice that they are not a particularly practical form of transportation within the city. The tradeoffs are simply not worth it:

- Cars make the city unbearable noisy. Traffic makes it hard to speak, hard to listen and increases the anxiety levels of everybody.
- Cars keep everybody on edge. People driving in the city need to be paying full attention to their driving, making them unable to relax in the commute. People walking or biking get an even worse deal: they need to be all the time aware of their surroundings because otherwise they will be killed by a fast-moving machine.
- Cars steal space. Street lanes, avenues; parking space, driving space, corners, roundabouts; you name it. The amount of physical space that we give away to cars makes up for most of the surface of the city if you don’t count confined walking areas such as parks. Think about a regular one way street with two lanes, that at any given time can have between 5 and 15 cars in the length between two streets: at an average of two persons per car, that’s 10 to 30 people. Think about how comfortable the space of that same street would be to the same amount of people, but on foot.
- Cars are expensive. Affluent societies with ideologically driven subsidies like the United States might not be used to this fact, but in most of the world owning and maintaining a car is a huge drain on the family income. As a form of transportation for commute, they are as expensive as it gets.
- Cars help maintain the hierarchical conception of the family. The normal role of the father as the driver contributes to the alienation of the other members of the family and helps accentuate the feeling of dependence*. The owner of the car holds a position of authority over the passengers that creates a hierarchical social dynamic that absent in public transportation.
- Cars pollute the air. It’s not just the planet, which is a big issue in itself: they pollute the air in their immediacy. Cars bring the quality of the air down in the common space of the street, and they do so significantly.**

_* Although the stereotype of father as the driver might eventually decline, the chauvinistic  myth associated with cars will not be erased easily. It is easy to see that the current idea of a sexualized car has been shaped by the pre existing patriarchal order._

_** While it’s true that electric cars would provide a solution to this particular drawback, we still don’t know if electric cars will become a mainstream reality anytime soon._

Now take a step back and think about how crazy it is that there are murder metal boxes running at high speed between the houses. That each time that you cross a street you are liable to lose your life. It’s downright insane. 

## So, about the self-driving ones…

What makes the idea of self-driving cars utterly dumb is that it completely fails to acknowledge any of the above-mentioned problems with cars. Technology is a wonderful thing, but it is always half the picture; the other half being **what** technology we create, and **how** we use it. Self-driving cars are one of those ideas that come up in the context of people being unable to think big, to really challenge the conceptions of the present era and innovate in a direction worth taking. After reasoning through the tradeoffs of cars it becomes obvious that making them self-driving can only create a new set of problems on top of the existing ones. 

Much has been discussed about the implied moral and ethical conundrums that this technology introduced, which look fresh out of a “Philosophy for dummies” picture book. Computer nerds discussing [whether the driver or the programmer is responsible for the car deciding which person to kill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/08/what-we-know-about-car-hacking-the-cia-and-those-wikileaks-claims/) is a sad picture. It goes to show how blind people has become to the deeper question: 

> Why do we have an easily accessible technology on the streets that is a serious life hazard and kills people everyday, even when used properly?

Self-driving cars is such a silly idea because it is so linear, so uninspired, so much the product of a mind used to think about innovation in terms of automating the things we already have.

### Why the hell do we have cars in the first place?

The reason behind the popularity of cars is complex, and there are many aspects to it. There is the fact that cars symbolize the industrial society, that they are a steady source of economical development, that their production provides employment, that they are a rather convenient form of transportation. There is also the fact that cars serve as an avatar for the [masculinity of the American man](https://books.google.se/books?id=ym3JHm0MyooC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=cars+phallic+symbols&source=bl&ots=7mRG4fTwzO&sig=LKtft81pJ_fco8nunKISrz8Slu4&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX0-vu4afUAhXIDCwKHZkPB0AQ6AEIWTAG#v=onepage&q=cars%20phallic%20symbols&f=false), with all its marketing and ideological implications. But truth is that, while those reasons can very well explain how we **arrived** at the current state of affairs, none of those reasons is enough to justify keeping things that way.

Cars do provide a solution for the set of problems that they address, but there are more efficient ways of solving them:

- Fast transportation: Metro. The metro is the most significant tool of city transportation. It doesn’t disrupt the landscape, it doesn’t pollute, it is actually fast, it can be made pretty silent and it serves as a way for the city to express its identity.
- Emergency transportation: lanes for emergency services, connected to the hospitals, police stations and fireman centers. Emergency transportation can only get **more** effective by removing all other cars from the city, so this is a net win.
- Transportation for the disabled: for those able to operate a wheelchair or an electric wheelchair, turning the whole street into a sidewalk* is beneficial. For those that need to be driven by someone else, it is easy to accommodate a slow-moving, rickshaw-like motorcycle that can be used in the bicycle lanes.
- Comfort transportation through the city space: this is arguably the need with the lowest priority, since a well-run metro can provide comfort as well as speed. The truth is that comfort might lose its position as the peak ideological value: after all, sitting in a car for commute is one of the reasons leading to overweight. For those truly unwilling to walk or bike to the metro station (or taking the metro itself), it can be arranged to have a slow-moving** electric tricycle type of transport in the bicycle lanes.

_* Isn’t it amazing that we call the sidewalk, well, side-walk? The ideological dream in which the car is the most important feature of the city is so deep that we consider people walking to be something on the side, not the central aspect of the street, which is of course given to the all-important cars._

_** It is absolutely crucial that motorized transport through the bike lanes is slow moving; it is what makes the difference between having small, single person transports for those that need it and having a street full of cars. Slow speed would have to be barely above walking speed, much like a golf caddy or an airport in-doors transportation vehicle._

## Why is it such a popular idea then?

The most obvious reason is that “self-driving cars” is a very buzz worthy three-word phrase; but this reason is not the most interesting one. Let’s focus on realities that are both harder to see and harder to change. 

### 4. Cars provide intimacy

Having such intimacy is a clearly perceived need in our individual centric worldview. Being exposed to others can be uncomfortable and unnerving, and people cherish the opportunity to have some space that can be protected from the chaos of the street. The irony is that most of the chaos in the street is actually a consequence of the public space being sequestered by cars.

If in order to function without cars we need to give an intimate feel to the open street for comfort, that can be arranged. The metro can be further developed to get a more comfortable space. Passenger cars with private compartments can be added. Urbanists can make use of the free surface that we would have to create gardens, galleries and other protected spaces that feel less exposed. There are many solutions to be found.

### 3. Cars remain a huge high-tech industry that provides good income and employment to millions

This arguments is not good, because it falls victim to the sunk cost fallacy; the fact that we invested in cars so far does not mean that we need to keep investing in them. The same jobs and income can come from the industry of the metro, fancy bicycles and other alternative forms of transportation, much like jobs and income provided by the fossil fuels industry can be shifted to green energy.

### 2. We remain a hierarchical society where the rich feel entitled to take over the public space

Cars create hierarchy on the common space. The rich(er) are comfortable in their cars that claim the best part of the city. The poor(er) are relegated to be always afraid of losing their lives in the traffic and to walk in the small, cramped sidewalk.

### 1. Private capital can’t deal with city-spanning changes or societal reform

Our fascination with this technology is a clear example of the cultural limitations of our current social order, and specifically of the innovation style that has been the norm in the startup ecosystem.

Self-driving cars are backed by venture capital, which can only back and develop products to be put in a market. The logic behind private capital funding and the startup dynamics makes it impossible for them to invest in something that would actually make a difference at the level of the entire city landscape.

This is to some extent a good thing. Private capital should not be the driving force behind city rebuilding, but given that the track record of government institutions in this regard is pretty bad, it is sad to think that the most enthusiastic and energized innovators in society can probably do very little about this.

#### Venture capitalists and startup founders are very often spoiled rich kids.

Venture capitalists and startup founders are pretty sold on the idea of trickle-down: all innovation seems to start as an expensive toy for the rich and slowly becomes a commodity for the masses. The smartphone, the personal computer, the microwave oven, the television: a lot of modern wonders have followed this seemingly physical law of economy dynamics. Tesla Motor followed this logic, and it has become closer and closer to achieve its stated purpose of providing commodity electric cars to the masses.

The thing is, optimizing bad ideas is not the same as creating a new tool that will eventually be accessible to everybody. Thinking about how cool it is that some expensive cars drive themselves misses the fact that the benefit goes entirely to the car owner, and provides no value to the rest of society. If anything, it threatens the livelihood of professional drivers (which one can suspect to be the point of the whole thing).

## In conclusion

Cars are deeply ingrained in the ideological substrate of consumerism.

Cars and consumerist society were born at the same time, out of the same worldview, and fed on each other in a very successful feedback loop. It will be very hard for us to overcome the fascination with cars if we are not ready to overcome the driving forces of consumerism.

In light of that, allow me to repeat myself:

**Cars are weapons.**

This is one of those self-evident truths that one has to be extremely deep in the ideological pit not to be able to see–yet as a society we are only starting to wake up to this fact. We only started to realize now, because cars are being used as tools for terrorism.

Let’s get these murder weapons out of our streets.
