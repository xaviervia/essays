# The Predatory Ratio

The predatory ratio is the hypothesis that a refinement of the supply and demand economical theory is possible that takes into account a critical ratio between supply and demand in which to sustain the growth in the market as a whole the curve of price change (either maximization in case the demand is larger than the supply or minimization in the opposite case) must flatten. This ratio is called the predatory ratio so to imply that for a supplier in a supplier’s market to use the price according to the standard supply-demand curve is actually predatory, insofar as consumers are in no position to defend their interests. This is mirrored in a consumer in a demander’s market paying a too cheap a price because they can enforce their market power.

The hypothesis is thus that such ratio exists that can be demonstrated in a mathematical game to produce more growth. It is assumed that the game might need to have some minimum amount of complexity for a natural critical ratio to be ostensible. 

This hypothesis is sustained on the general perception of fairness regarding actors that do not exploit their market power even when conditions would allow them according to standard economic theory. It is also aimed at preventing hydraulic dictatorships.
